## 📝 Step-by-Step Test Procedure

### Question 1: x² - 5x + 6 = 0

**Step 1: View the Question**
- You should see:
  - Question prompt in LaTeX
  - Status badge showing "UNANSWERED"
  - Work area (optional text field)
  - "Final Answer:" label with blue-bordered math field
  - Two buttons: "🔮 Calculate Result" and "✓ Check Answer"

**Step 2: Use Calculate Feature**
- Click "🔮 Calculate Result"
- You should see a purple box appear with:
  ```
  💡 Calculated Result:
  x₁ = 2.000, x₂ = 3.000
  Two real roots (discriminant = 1.00)
  ```

**Step 3: Enter Answer**
- Click in the "Final Answer" field (blue border)
- Type: `2, 3`
- Notice the blue border indicating it's the answer field

**Step 4: Check Answer**
- Click "✓ Check Answer"
- You should see:
  - ✅ Green checkmark with "Correct!"
  - Answer field border turns GREEN
  - Status badge changes to "CORRECT" (green)
  - Question card gets green left border
  - Progress bar updates to "1/5 answered (1 correct)"
  - Button changes to "✓ Checked" and becomes disabled

---

### Question 2: x² - 4 = 0

**Test negative values and order independence:**

1. Click "🔮 Calculate Result"
   - Should show: `x₁ = 2.000, x₂ = -2.000`

2. Enter in DIFFERENT order: `-2, 2`
   - This tests that order doesn't matter

3. Click "✓ Check Answer"
   - Should still be CORRECT ✅
   - Progress updates to "2/5 answered (2 correct)"

---

### Question 3: Test Incorrect Answer

**Test x² + 2x - 8 = 0 with wrong answer:**

1. Calculate: Should show `x₁ = 2.000, x₂ = -4.000`

2. Enter WRONG answer: `1, 3`

3. Click "✓ Check Answer"
   - Should show: ❌ "Incorrect. Expected: -4, 2"
   - Answer field border turns RED
   - Status badge shows "INCORRECT" (red)
   - Question card gets red left border
   - Progress: "3/5 answered (2 correct)"

---

### Question 5: Test Repeated Root

**Test x² + 6x + 9 = 0:**

1. Calculate: Should show `x = -3.000 (repeated root)`

2. Can enter either way:
   - Just `-3`
   - Or `-3, -3`
   - Both should be CORRECT ✅

---

## 🎨 Visual Features to Verify

- **Red** - Incorrect

### Answer Field Borders
- **Blue (2px solid)** - Default final answer field
- **Green** - Correct answer
- **Red** - Incorrect answer

### Progress Bar
- **Text**: "X/Y answered (Z correct)"
- **Animated fill**: Grows from 0% to 100%
- **Percentage**: Shown inside bar when visible
- **Gradient**: Blue gradient fill

1. **`css/worksheet.css`** - Added 200+ lines of styling:
   - `.work-area` - Dashed text area
   - `.answer-field` - Blue-bordered answer box
   - `.btn-compute`, `.btn-check` - Action buttons
   - `.computed-result` - Purple calculation box
   - `.feedback` - Enhanced feedback styling
   - `.status-badge` - Status indicators
   - `.progress-section` - Progress bar styles

2. **`js/mathlive-handler.js`** - Added methods:
   - `createQuestionFields()` - Creates work area + answer field
   - `applyFeedback()` - Applies visual feedback to fields

3. **`js/worksheet-loader.js`** - Added functions:
   - `computeAnswer()` - Calculates quadratic roots
   - `checkSingleAnswer()` - Validates individual question
   - `showFeedback()` - Displays feedback message
   - `updateQuestionStatus()` - Updates badges and borders

## 📊 Backward Compatibility

✅ **Fully backward compatible!**

- Worksheets WITHOUT `meta.coefficients`: No Calculate button appears
- Old worksheets: Still work with new interface
- Submit All button: Still works as before
- All existing functionality: Preserved

---

## 🐛 Troubleshooting

### Calculate Button Not Showing
**Problem**: Button missing
**Solution**: Ensure JSON has `meta.coefficients` with `a`, `b`, `c`

### Answer Not Checking
**Problem**: Nothing happens on click
**Solution**: Enter an answer first (field must not be empty)

### Progress Not Updating
**Problem**: Bar stays at 0%
**Solution**: Check browser console for errors; ensure all IDs exist

### Wrong Answer Accepted
**Problem**: Incorrect answer shows as correct
**Solution**: Check `marking.method` is `solution_set` for quadratics
